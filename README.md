# Identification of Complementarity-determining region3(CDRH3) on the heavy chain using a logistic regression model

Methods

I used a logistic regression model to create a machine learning model to return a vector of predicted class labels for the predictor data in the matrixes we created. Logistic Regression is a machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification or regression problems.

Data was divided for training and testing purposes for the entire dataset. I created a subset file of 500 sequences from the entire dataset.
